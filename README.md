Hello!
I am ready to present a new bot for buying and selling on the StepN platform! StepN Market Bot v1.0.0(by jeseeee)

Archive password: market

At the moment, the bot can automatically buy and sell sneakers.
The bot provides protection against sharp drops of floor sneakers.
The bot has been tested for the last 7 days. Alpha testers of the bot were 4 people. During these 7 days, the total profit from sales and purchases amounted to 290% of the initial balance.
Attention! The bot has blocking protection. For 7 days of active use of the bot, there were no blockings!

Below you can see the settings that the bot uses at the moment:
 delay - reload page delay (in ms)
 minBuyPrice - minimum price for buying in SOL/BSC
 maxBuyPrice - maximum price for buying in SOL/BSC
 network - SOL or BSC
 looped - start new loop after buying
 mode - Bot have 2 mods: buy/buysell
 sellPrice - if you set buy mod - enter null. if you set buysell mod, you need to enter price up%. Example, if you want sneakers to be sold at a profit of 5%, then set 5. Thus, the sneaker is put up for sale 11% higher than the purchase price.
